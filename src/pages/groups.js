        Currently offering an Activity-Oriented group designed to help individuals who struggle with negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Negative symptoms (apathy, lethargy, social withdrawal, blunting of affect, poverty of speech and thought, anhedonia, loss of motivation, and lack social interest) is the main barrier to a better quality of life for patients with schizophrenia. The objective of the this Activity-Oriented Therapy group is to improve the patientâ€™s functional capacity and quality of life. In addition, this group is good for anyone struggling with anxiety and depression who may need additional support with re-integrating back in the society/community after a long period of isolation.
