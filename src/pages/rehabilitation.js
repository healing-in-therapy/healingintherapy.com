          I specialize in providing intensive psychotherapy and case management services to promote recovery and wellness for adults and older adults with persistent and severe mental illness. I meet with clients in my office, or at their home, including in the field. I want to increase geographic proximity of my services so that my clients will be able to receive individualized, personalized responses to their needs within a reasonable period of time in case of a crisis.

        <h2>More Information</h2>

        <p>
          The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) describes mental illness as a condition that affects a person's thinking, feeling or mood. Such conditions may affect someone's ability to relate to others and function each day. Each person will have different experiences, even people with the same diagnosis. Recovery, including meaningful roles in social life, school and work, is possible, especially when you start treatment early and play a strong role in your own recovery process. A mental health condition isnâ€™t the result of one event. Research suggests multiple, linking causes. Genetics, environment and lifestyle influence whether someone develops a mental health condition. A stressful job or home life makes some people more susceptible, as do traumatic life events like being the victim of a crime. Biochemical processes and circuits and basic brain structure may play a role, too.
