          Hello! My name is Kayla Mach and I am a Licensed Marriage and Family
          Therapist in the state of California, specifically Orange County. I
          have been working in the field of mental health serving Orange County
          residents since 2010. I have mainly worked in mental health outpatient
          clinics in the past 10 years serving clients with severe and
          persistent mental illnesses.

        <p>
          As a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, I am deeply invested in
          the growth and mental health of my clients. I understand the pains in
          life of feeling stuck, lost, unseen, or feeling alone despite much
          efforts for change. My desire to work with individuals is fueled by my
          passion to help those who are thinking about making changes in their
          life. I am passionate about helping you gain a better understanding of
          who you are and walk alongside you as you embark on your journey to
          healing, finding restoration and a new life. I want to create a
          comfortable, supportive and nonjudgmental environment for you to
          examine your life and tell your life story.
        </p>

        <p>
          Together, I will work collaboratively with you to identify maladaptive
          behavior patterns that have prevented you from achieving the life you
          desire. I have worked with a wide variety of clients in different
          settings ranging from clients experiencing psychosocial stressors to
          acute psychiatric disorders. As a result of my wide range of
          experiences, I believe I can help you overcome the barriers that are
          preventing you from moving toward the right direction. I provide a
          highly personalized approach, utilizing various therapeutic techniques
          to target each of my clientâ€™s needs and presenting problems.
