          Therapy is a safe, supportive, empathic space to explore the aspects of self you may not be willing or able to explore within the context of friendships or other personal relationships. Meeting with a therapist can be extremely nerve wracking and uncomfortable at first, but if open to the process, it can be one of the most valuable experiences of your life. I am here to provide you with a safe and nonjudgmental environment for you to examine your life, tell your life story, uncover-maladaptive behavior patterns and learn evidenced-based coping skills to make changes in your life to achieve the life you truly desire. My agenda is about you and your wellness. My hope is to help you discover new insights, gain understanding and learn about the positive and negative impacts of how early life experiences play a role in your current mode of functioning.

        <h2>Psychotherapeutic Treatment Modalities</h2>

        <p>
          <b>Psychodynamic</b> is known as insight oriented therapy. The goal of Psychodynamic Therapy is to help you gain self-awareness and understanding of the influences of the past on present behavior. In other words, the psychodynamic approach will enable you to examine unresolved conflicts and symptoms that arise from past dysfunctional relationships and how it manifest themselves in current relationships.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy</b> focuses on helping you deal with a very specific problem such as phobias, addictions, depression and anxiety. The underlying concept behind CBT is people often experience negative thoughts or feelings that are reinforced by faulty beliefs.  Such beliefs can result in problematic behaviors that can affect numerous life areas, including family, romantic relationships, work and academics.  The goal of CBT is to help you combat these destructive thoughts and behaviors by working collaboratively with you to identify the problematic beliefs. In order for CBT to be effective, you must be ready and willing to spend time and effort to analyze your thoughts and feelings.  Such self-analysis can be difficult, but it is a great way to learn more about how internal states impact outward behavior.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Narrative Therapy</b> Conversations can shape new realities and meanings of our livings. The meaning we build for our lives can heal and provide hope, change and restoration.
