          Childhood experiences play a role in adult relationships in various ways.  Understanding how those experiences and mode of communication earlier in life effects your current relationship is vital for relationship cure between partners.  My desire is to help couple rekindle the positive feelings and re-connect.   In couples therapy, I use research-based couples counseling approaches such as The Gottman Methods to help my couples restore intimacy and connection. I actively guide and coach couples to learn new ways of communicating and encouraging the couple to practice these communication skills in session. I have completed Level 3 Practicum Training Couples therapy and I am excited to use these tools and interventions to help my couples.
